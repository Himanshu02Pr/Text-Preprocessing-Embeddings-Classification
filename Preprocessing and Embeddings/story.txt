Mira lived in a quiet village surrounded by misty hills. Every morning, she wandered through the old forest on her way to the river. One day, while following a trail of bright blue butterflies, she discovered a rusty gate hidden behind thick vines. Curious, she pushed it open and stepped into a forgotten garden. Flowers of every colour bloomed wildly, and a small stone fountain sat in the centre, still trickling with clear water. As Mira explored the garden, she noticed a wooden box buried beneath a rose bush. Inside it was a faded journal filled with stories about the garden’s magic—stories written by her grandmother many years ago. From that day on, Mira visited the hidden garden whenever she felt lonely. And slowly, the garden came back to life, just as the stories promised.
